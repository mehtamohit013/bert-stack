Using Android 2.3.5 on Galaxy S 2\\\\nI tried searching google, but it just gave me stuff about how to make the battery last longer, nothing about how to check that.\\\\n\", \\'Title\\': \\'How to check how much battery the data network is using?\\'}': 1, 'id_{\\'Id\\': 6154, \\'AcceptedAnswerId\\': 6155.0, \\'AnswerCount\\': 1.0, \\'AnswerIds\\': [], \\'Attachments\\': None, \\'OS\\': None, \\'PostTypeId\\': 1, \\'Related\\': [10294, 158338, 3052, 181528, 17382, 35093, 77410, 3405, 12150], \\'Score\\': 7, \\'Tags\\': [\\'htc-droid-incredible\\', \\'battery\\', \\'battery-life\\'], \\'Text\\': \"Over the past couple of days, the battery usage of my new phone has been as follows:\\\\n\\\\n34% - Android System\\\\n  28% - Cell Standby\\\\n  21% - Phone idle\\\\n  10% - Display\\\\n  03% - Google Goggles\\\\n  02% - Angry Birds\\\\n  02% - Majesty\\\\n\\\\nThis feels very off to me.

culprits..\\n\\nAnd the primary culprit is that /winsxs or \"Windows Side-By-Side\" folder.\\n\\nWhat is the Windows Side By Side folder? Well, that's explained pretty well here.\\n\\nAll of the components in the operating system are found in the WinSxS folder – in fact we call this location the component store.  Each component has a unique name that includes the version, language, and processor architecture that it was built for.  The WinSxS folder is the only location that the component is found on the system, all other instances of the files that you see on the system are “projected” by hard linking from the component store.  Let me repeat that last point – there is only one instance (or full data copy) of each version of each file in the OS, and that instance is located in the WinSxS folder.   So looked at from that perspective, the WinSxS folder is really the entirety of the whole OS, referred to as a \"flat\" in down-level operating systems.  This also accounts for why you will no longer be prompted for media when running operations such as System File Checker (SFC), or when installing additional features and roles.\\nThat explains why the folder starts off big, but not why it gets larger over time – the answer to that question is servicing.   In previous versions of Windows the atomic unit of servicing was the file, in Windows Vista it’s the component.  When we update a particular binary we release a new version of the whole component, and that new version is stored alongside the original one in the component store.  The higher version of the component is projected onto the system, but the older version in the store isn’t touched.  The reason for that is the third part of why the component store gets so large.\\n\\nLots of other people complaining about the size of the /winsxs folder, too:\\n\\nA coworker recently received his every two year work laptop refresh and was in the middle of loading his new laptop with Vista. For some reason, his hard drive C: was partitioned to only 25GB and the rest of the space reserved for a much larger drive D:.\\nAnyway, after loading many Windows Updates, he was left with hardly any drive space left on C:, and for some reason, the WinSxS directory had ballooned to over 8GB.\\nWhile I knew what the WinSxS (Windows Side-by-Side) directory was for, I wasn't quite sure why that directory would explode in size so fast with normal operating system updates.\\n\\nI don't really care about having all these duplicate files for safety, but I do care about the VM exploding due to an out of disk space error. So.. can /winsxs be safely pared down in any way? It doesn't seem that it can be.. \\n\\nAdministrators should not, for any reason, take it upon themselves to clean out the /winsxs directory - doing so may prevent Windows Update and MSI from functioning properly afterwards.  Preventing accidental deletion from the directory is accomplished by putting a strong security descriptor on the directory that inherits to its children.\\n\\nIf this /winsxs folder gets any larger, I'm going to have to re-image this virtual machine.. which I really don't want to do!\\n   \n","591                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Beyond each platform toolkit of course.\\nHow come Firefox UI looks, mmhh well, not that good on Linux,  it's pretty decent in Windows and it definitely rocks on OSX?\\nIs it a single product recompiled for different platforms?

Many applications and a great number of games work in fullscreen mode, and if you press this key accidentally, most of times because you wanted to press the Ctrl or Alt keys, the application usually freezes for a while and  minimizes itself. If you are lucky, your videogame will pause, but sometimes it continues even when it is minimized.\\nIs it possible to disable the 'Windows' key?\\nIt would be possible to show the Start menu with another combination of keys? I would like to keep combinations that use the Windows key working, like Windows+L, which leaves current session.\\n   \n","2937                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Sometimes when I'm working in Windows I'll get this prompt when I try to delete a directory:\\n\\nFolder In Use\\nThe action can't be completed because the folder is open in another program\\nClose the folder and try again.\\n\\nHowever, the folder isn't \"in use\" at all, and I don't have it open.

and wireless. Wired is connected to one router, the wireless to another router (different networks). Wired is working with proxy settings only, Wireless is an internet access for guests. \\nNormally I use wired network and if I need to access internet without proxy server, I got to connect to wireless network and turn proxy settings off for that moment. \\nIs there a way to have both networks on, and use one specific browser via wireless network only without proxy settings while being connected to wired and the proxy settings on?\\n1.Tried to fiddle around with Chrome but it inherits system's settings :-(\\n2. Tried to use google, I am usually good with googling.

If it were say, 4/30/19, I want the prorated date to read 6/30/19, so always the june 30th after whatever date.\\n   \n","1474607                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I need to remove all mapped network locations from navigation pane and only from the navigation pane for a very specific reason which is mentioned in this question.\\n\\nThis seems like the only way to avoid that specific issue mentioned in that question.
